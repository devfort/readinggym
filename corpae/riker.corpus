Not if I weaken first. The unexpected is our normal routine. Well, that's certainly good to know. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Sorry, Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Talk about going nowhere fast. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? We have a saboteur aboard. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Travel time to the nearest starbase? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. I'll be sure to note that in my log. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Your head is not an artifact! What? We're not at all alike! I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. I am your worst nightmare! The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. This should be interesting. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Besides, you look good in a dress. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Computer, belay that order. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Computer, lights up! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking

Wouldn't that bring about chaos? I'll be sure to note that in my log. This should be interesting. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Your shields were failing, sir. Your head is not an artifact! Damage report! Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Computer, lights up! Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. They were just sucked into space. You enjoyed that. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you.

Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Well, that's certainly good to know. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll alert the crew. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. and attack the Romulans. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. We have a saboteur aboard. How long can two people talk about nothing? Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? I am your worst nightmare! You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Shields up! Rrrrred alert!
