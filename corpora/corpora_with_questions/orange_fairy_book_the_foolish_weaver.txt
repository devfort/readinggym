Text:
Once a weaver, who was in want of work, took service with a certain
farmer as a shepherd.

The farmer, knowing that the man was very slow-witted, gave him most
careful instructions as to everything that he was to do.

Finally he said: 'If a wolf or any wild animal attempts to hurt the
flock you should pick up a big stone like this' (suiting the action to
the word) 'and throw a few such at him, and he will be afraid and go
away.' The weaver said that he understood, and started with the flocks
to the hillsides where they grazed all day.

By chance in the afternoon a leopard appeared, and the weaver instantly
ran home as fast as he could to get the stones which the farmer had
shown him, to throw at the creature. When he came back all the flock
were scattered or killed, and when the farmer heard the tale he beat him
soundly. 'Were there no stones on the hillside that you should run back
to get them, you senseless one?' he cried; 'you are not fit to herd
sheep. To-day you shall stay at home and mind my old mother who is sick,
perhaps you will be able to drive flies off her face, if you can't drive
beasts away from sheep!'

So, the next day, the weaver was left at home to take care of the
farmer's old sick mother. Now as she lay outside on a bed, it turned out
that the flies became very troublesome, and the weaver looked round for
something to drive them away with; and as he had been told to pick up
the nearest stone to drive the beasts away from the flock, he thought he
would this time show how cleverly he could obey orders. Accordingly he
seized the nearest stone, which was a big, heavy one, and dashed it at
the flies; but, unhappily, he slew the poor old woman also; and then,
being afraid of the wrath of the farmer, he fled and was not seen again
in that neighbourhood.

All that day and all the next night he walked, and at length he came to
a village where a great many weavers lived together.

'You are welcome,' said they. 'Eat and sleep, for to-morrow six of us
start in search of fresh wool to weave, and we pray you to give us your
company.'

'Willingly,' answered the weaver. So the next morning the seven weavers
set out to go to the village where they could buy what they wanted. On
the way they had to cross a ravine which lately had been full of water,
but now was quite dry. The weavers, however, were accustomed to swim
over this ravine; therefore, regardless of the fact that this time it
was dry, they stripped, and, tying their clothes on their heads, they
proceeded to swim across the dry sand and rocks that formed the bed of
the ravine. Thus they got to the other side without further damage than
bruised knees and elbows, and as soon as they were over, one of them
began to count the party to make sure that all were safe there. He
counted all except himself, and then cried out that somebody was
missing! This set each of them counting; but each made the same mistake
of counting all except himself, so that they became certain that one
of their party was missing! They ran up and down the bank of the ravine
wringing their hands in great distress and looking for signs of their
lost comrade. There a farmer found them and asked what was the matter.
'Alas!' said one, 'seven of us started from the other bank and one must
have been drowned on the crossing, as we can only find six remaining!'
The farmer eyed them a minute, and then, picking up his stick, he dealt
each a sounding blow, counting, as he did so, 'One! two! three!' and so
on up to the seven. When the weavers found that there were seven of them
they were overcome with gratitude to one whom they took for a magician
as he could thus make seven out of an obvious six.
